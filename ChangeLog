2001-04-29 Ryan T. Sammartino <ryants@home.com>
	* lisp/doxymacs.el: Now parse XML tags file generated by doxygen 
	directly.
	* lisp/xml-parse.el: Add this file so that people don't need to go 
	download things from all over the place just to get doxymacs working.
	* perl/doxytags.pl: No longer necessary, now that we can parse the
	XML tags file generated by doxygen.

2001-04-22 Ryan T. Sammartino <ryants@home.com>
	* lisp/doxymacs.el: Function documentation
	
2001-04-18 Ryan T. Sammartino <ryants@home.com>
	* lisp/doxymacs.el: Going with Kris' "new style" look up
	code. It's excellent, and exactly what I wanted.  Thanks Kris.  Also
	incorprated Andreas Fuchs' patch for loading tags from a URL.

2001-04-11 Ryan T. Sammartino <ryants@home.com>
	* lisp/doxymacs.el: insert blank or "file" doxygen comments with style
	specified by the user.

2001-03-31 Ryan T. Sammartino <ryants@home.com>
	* lisp/doxymacs.el: if symbol matches more than one entry in the tags,
	you can now select which one you really mean (but please take a look
	at the FIXME comment before doxymacs-choose-match) and slightly
	changed the format of the list that doxymacs-get-matches returns.
	* perl/doxytag.pl, example/doc/doxy.tag: added some more info to the 
	third column of doxytag.pl's output.
	* TODO: removed the "choose which symbol you really mean" item (yay!).
	
2001-03-28 Ryan T. Sammartino <ryants@home.com>
	* lisp/doxymacs.el: applied patch from Kris Verbeeck so that
	doxymacs customisation stuff is under the "Tools" group.  Also
	removed doxymacs-browser, since we'll just use the user's default
	browser anyways.  Minor formatting changes as well.
	* README: added doxymacs' URL

2001-03-24 Ryan T. Sammartino <ryants@home.com>
	* doxymacs: Initial CVS check in.
