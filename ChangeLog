	* lisp/doxymacs.el: insert blank or "file" doxygen comments with style
	specified by the user.

2001-03-31 Ryan T. Sammartino <ryants@home.com>
	* lisp/doxymacs.el: if symbol matches more than one entry in the tags,
	you can now select which one you really mean (but please take a look
	at the FIXME comment before doxymacs-choose-match) and slightly
	changed the format of the list that doxymacs-get-matches returns.
	* perl/doxytag.pl, example/doc/doxy.tag: added some more info to the 
	third column of doxytag.pl's output.
	* TODO: removed the "choose which symbol you really mean" item (yay!).
	
2001-03-28 Ryan T. Sammartino <ryants@home.com>
	* lisp/doxymacs.el: applied patch from Kris Verbeeck so that
	doxymacs customisation stuff is under the "Tools" group.  Also
	removed doxymacs-browser, since we'll just use the user's default
	browser anyways.  Minor formatting changes as well.
	* README: added doxymacs' URL

2001-03-24 Ryan T. Sammartino <ryants@home.com>
	* doxymacs: Initial CVS check in.
