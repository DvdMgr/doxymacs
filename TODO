lisp/doxymacs.el:
 - add ability to get tag file from a URL as well as a local file.
 - add ability to automagically insert doxygen comments.
   - we sort of have that now... now work on allowing for a "user" style.
 - add some default key-bindings 
 - error checking (invalid tags file format, etc).
 - test this on other versions of {X}Emacs other than the one I'm using 
   (XEmacs 21.1.14)
 - other stuff?

perl/doxytag.pl:

misc:
 - write a patch for the *real* doxytags program so that it will output our
   tags format, and submit it to the doxygen maintainer.
