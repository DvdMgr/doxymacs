lisp/doxymacs.el:
 - fix all FIXMEs (of course)
 - For a 1.4.0 release:
   - turn doxymacs-doxygen-root into an assoc list so you can associate
     path regexps with Doxygen documentation.  For example, you can
     associate buffers that are editting files under ~/project/foo with
     the Doxygen documentation for foo, ~/project/bar with the Doxygen 
     documentation for bar, etc.
   - similarly for doxymacs-doxygen-tags
   - incorporate patches posted to SF
   - automatic testing (DejaGnu)
 - other stuff?
