lisp/doxymacs.el:
 - add ability to get tag file from a URL as well as a local file.
 - add ability to automagically insert doxygen comments.
 - if doxymacs-get-matches finds more than one match, present user with list of choices
   to select from.  Use third element of list to distinguish each choice.
 - add some default key-bindings 
 - error checking (invalid tags file format, etc).
 - test this on other versions of {X}Emacs other than the one I'm using (XEmacs 21.1.14)
 - other stuff?
