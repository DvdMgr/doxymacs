06/06/2001 Version 1.0.0 released.
	The first stable release.  There are still some bugs left (see
	the FIXMEs in lisp/doxymacs.el), but they are both sufficiently
	rare and hard to fix that they don't warrant holding up a stable
	release.

26/05/2001 Version 0.2.1 released.
	Er... forgot to update this file the past few releases.
	Oh well.  Look at the ChangeLog if you really care.

09/05/2001 Version 0.1.1 released.
	Bug fix: C-? is a bad choice for "look up", since it causes the	
	DEL key to be mapped to "look up"... changed it to C-c d ?.
	Feature add: Progress info as it parses XML tag file.

07/05/2001 Version 0.1.0 (Alpha) released.
	This represents the first public release of doxymacs.  It works for us,
	now let's see if it works for other people too.
